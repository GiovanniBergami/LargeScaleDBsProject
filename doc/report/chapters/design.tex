=======
The application will allow its users to perform the following tasks:

\section{Client}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{View the map}
	\item \textbf{Move the map in a direction}, with the typical drag 'n drop
	\item \textbf{Increase or decrease the map magnifying}, with either buttons 
	or the mouse's wheel
	\item \textbf{Search for a specific place}, the following method are 
	supported:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item With an address
		\item With a POI's name
		\item With WGS84 geographical coordinates
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Ask for directions} between two intersections on the map
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Via car
		\item Via bicycle
		\item On foot
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Refresh active disruptions' data} clicking on the refresh button
\end{itemize}
\section{TIMS}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Create/Update a disruption}
	\item \textbf{Close a disruption}
	
	\end{itemize}
\section{Statician}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Access the analytics tools}
	\item \textbf{Display the disruptions' heatmap}
\end{itemize}
\input{chapters/design/nonFunctionalRequirements.tex}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item To solve a routing problem in an acceptable amount of time
	\item A cache for queries to have a better response time for frequent queries
	\item To find a good approximation of the optimal route
	\item Respect the access constraints on the graph, such as oneway streets
	\item Use a routing algorithm that uses an heuristic function to compute a path, such as A*, to avoid excessive exploration of the hypothesis space, since those algorithms are always exponential in the graph’s dimension
	\item Define a good heuristic to guide the algorithm on its visit on the graph, considering features such as the road’s classification, speed limit, the geographical distance between the vertices.
	\end{itemize}
