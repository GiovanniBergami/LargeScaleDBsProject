\input{chapters/design/mainActors.tex}
The application has three main actors:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Client
	\item TIMS
	\item Statician
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Client}
this user is able to view map and run searches on it and he’s also able to ask 
for directions between two points on the map.

\paragraph{TIMS}
this user is able to perform CRUD operations on the disruptions.

\paragraph{Statician}
this user is able to perform analytics on the data generated by TIMS.

\input{chapters/design/functionalReq.tex}
The application will allow its users to perform the following tasks:

\section{Client}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{View the map}
	\item \textbf{Move the map in a direction}, with the typical drag 'n drop
	\item \textbf{Increase or decrease the map magnifying}, with either buttons 
	or the mouse's wheel
	\item \textbf{Search for a specific place}, the following method are 
	supported:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item With an address
		\item With a POI's name
		\item With WGS84 geographical coordinates
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Ask for directions} between two intersections on the map
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Via car
		\item Via bicycle
		\item On foot
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section{TIMS}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Create/Update a disruption}
	\item \textbf{Close a disruption}
	
	\end{itemize}
\section{Statician}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Access the analytics tools}
	\item \textbf{Display the disruptions' heatmap}
\end{itemize}
\input{chapters/design/nonFunctionalRequirements.tex}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item To solve a routing problem in an acceptable amount of time
	\item A cache for queries to have a better response time for frequent queries
	\item To find a good approximation of the optimal route
	\item Respect the access constraints on the graph, such as oneway streets
	\item Use a routing algorithm that uses an heuristic function to compute a path, such as A*, to avoid excessive exploration of the hypothesis space, since those algorithms are always exponential in the graph’s dimension
	\item Define a good heuristic to guide the algorithm on its visit on the graph, considering features such as the road’s classification, speed limit, the geographical distance between the vertices.
	\end{itemize}
\input{chapters/design/capTheorem.tex}

In order to optimize performance for the anticipated high volume of read operations, it is essential to prioritize both high availability and low latency in the design of this application. Additionally, it is crucial that the system remains functional in the event of a partition.According to the CAP theorem, the design of this application should prioritize \textbf{Availability (A)} and \textbf{Partition Tolerance (P)} over Consistency (C). This means that the application is more focused on maintaining access to the system and tolerating partitioning rather than ensuring complete consistency of data.
