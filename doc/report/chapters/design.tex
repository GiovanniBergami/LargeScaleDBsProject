\input{chapters/design/mainActors.tex}
The application has three main actors:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Client
	\item TIMS
	\item Statician
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Client}
this user is able to view map and run searches on it and heâ€™s also able to ask 
for directions between two points on the map. The user don't need to be registered to use the application. With correct use of the app, the client can avoid inconvenience during their journey in the city of London, completing his visit in safety and minimizing delays.

\paragraph{TIMS}
this user is able to perform CRUD operations on the disruptions. TIMS, in pratics, is an API provided by Transport For London.

\paragraph{Statician}
this user is able to perform analytics on the data generated by TIMS. The statician can access his panel inserting the correct username and password. By acceding this panel he can view some different graphs that are useful to make statistics about security when travelling in London. Using these results, the statistician can identify critical issues in the city of London and suggest to the authorities any changes to traffic or simply indicate which areas are the most critical from this point of view.

\input{chapters/design/functionalReq.tex}

The application will allow its users to perform the following tasks:

\section{Client}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{View the map}
	\item \textbf{Move the map in a direction}, with the typical drag 'n drop
	\item \textbf{Increase or decrease the map magnifying}, with either buttons 
	or the mouse's wheel
	\item \textbf{Search for a specific place}, the following method are 
	supported:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item With an address
		\item With a POI's name
		\item With WGS84 geographical coordinates
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Ask for directions} between two intersections on the map
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Via car
		\item Via bicycle
		\item On foot
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Calculate the estimate time of travel}
	\item \textbf{View the path} on the map
	\item \textbf{View active disruptions' and POIs' informations}
	\item \textbf{View a suggestion list of POIs}, based on the string the user insert in the appropriate area
	\item \textbf{Refresh active disruptions' data} clicking on the refresh button
	\item \textbf{Choose if to consider or not disruptions} during the route calculation 
\end{itemize}
\section{TIMS}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Create/Update a disruption}
	\item \textbf{Close a disruption}
	\end{itemize}
\section{Statician}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Access the analytics tools}
	\item \textbf{Display the disruptions' heatmap}, chosen a certaine class
	\item \textbf{Choose the precision of the hehatmap between three grades:}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item High
		\item Medium
		\item Low
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Visualize a graph about hourly statistics chosen a class of disruption}
	\item \textbf{Visualize a table that contains the most common disruption for each severity considering the area actually displayed on the screen}
	\item \textbf{Update the table}
\end{itemize}

\input{chapters/design/capTheorem.tex}

In order to optimize performance for the anticipated high volume of read operations, it is essential to prioritize both high availability and low latency in the design of this application. Additionally, it is crucial that the system remains functional in the event of a partition.According to the CAP theorem, the design of this application should prioritize \textbf{Availability (A)} and \textbf{Partition Tolerance (P)} over Consistency (C). This means that the application is more focused on maintaining access to the system and tolerating partitioning rather than ensuring complete consistency of data.
